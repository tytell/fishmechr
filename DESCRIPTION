Description: Processes tracked points on a fish's body and uses them to estimate 
    standard kinematic parameters such as tail beat amplitude and frequency, body 
    wavelength and wavespeed. As part of this, it also estimates the location
    of the center of mass and the principal swimming axis. The techniques are
    described in detail in the main vignette and are published in the book
    chapter Hawkins, O.H., Di Santo, V., Tytell, Eric.D., 2025. "Biomechanics and 
    energetics of swimming", in: Higham, T.E., Lauder, G.V. (Eds.), Integrative 
    Fish Biomechanics, Fish Physiology. Academic Press.
