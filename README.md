## Summary

In this package, we put together a pipeline for analyzing fish swimming kinematics based on points digitized from video and calculating key swimming parameters. The package assumes that you have already digitized a set of points along the fish body and are looking to estimate tail beat frequency or amplitude, body excursion, swimming wavelength or wave speed.

The toolbox is decscribed in detail in Hawkins, O.H., Di Santo, V., Tytell, Eric. D., 2025. Biomechanics and energetics of swimming, in: Higham, T.E., Lauder, G.V. (Eds.), Integrative Fish Biomechanics, Fish Physiology. Academic Press. https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.fp.2025.06.003 and in [the vignette](https://tytell.github.io/fishmechr/articles/fishmechr.html).
