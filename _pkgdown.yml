    Main functions for estimating kinematic parameters from midline data.
    These are more or less in the order you would use them.

    Functions ending in `_df` operate on a data frame and often add multiple
    columns to the data frame. The data frame should have two identifier
    columns:

      * `frame`: Identifies instants in time
      * `point`: Identifies locations along the body, so that they can be
        ordered from head to tail.

    To use identifier columns with different names, the functions take options
    `.frame` and `.point`.

    To change the names of the output columns, the functions use an option
    `.out`. `.out` can be a vector containing the names of the columns, or
    a named list.
